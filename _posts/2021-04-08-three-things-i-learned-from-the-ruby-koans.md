title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

 1. I learned regex! I've always heard about regex but had no idea how it actually worked. Through the completion of the regex koans, I learned a lot about how useful it can be for searching strings.
 2. I learned a lot about exception handling. Again, through working with software engineers, I've heard this term a lot over the years. Many of the Koans touched on this concept and it was very helpful to understand what an exception is, how to dictate what to do under different circumstances, and several examples of common exceptions like "NoMethodError."
 3. I also learned about classes that I had never used before. Learning the differences between symbols, hashes, arrays, and others was very helpful in broadly understanding how data gets stored in Ruby and how to access it.
